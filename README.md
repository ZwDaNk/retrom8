## The Loader
The loader worked by checking players and seeing if they were in a Roblox group, and if said user was in said group, it would import a model into the whitelisted player's PlayerGui. A example of this would be that Joe is the leader of a secret club in a alleyway. However, only specific people are allowed in that secret club if they have a pass. Now let's introduce Bob. Bob tries to ask Joe if he can enter in, but doesn't have a pass. Joe forbids Bob from getting in, because Bob doesn't have a pass. Let's introduce Alice, someone who sells passes. Bob buys a pass from Alice for 1 dollar. Then, Bob goes back to Joe. Now due to Bob having a pass, Bob is allowed in the secret club.
## Blocks used in the loader
* Is In Group - Detects if a specific player is in a group.
* If - Checks if the user is in a group. If said player was in a group, it would use the next block listed below.
* Insert Model - Inserts a model ID onto someone, specifically in PlayerGui.
